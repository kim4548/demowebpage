      <p>You find that freedom is not bound by anything and you don't think You can see new things, find fun, and enjoy them Each one has a different standard of beauty, but I think it's the best condition to find joy as much as you're free We present that</p>

        <h2>Simple is Best</h2>
        <p>Simplicity can be boring or dull. But ra
          ther than filling it up, taking it out, erasing it, beautiful 
          is not complicated, beautiful can be colorful, but I think it comes
           from simplicity that you see the longer you show subtlety in it

          <p>YWe make vessels and vas
            es using soil as the standard of beauty tha
            t we think of. Pottery takes a lot of time and lab
            or. But I think the artist's thoughts, his mind, his
             philosophy are naturally conveyed through his ha
            nds. And so we have that aesthetic of freedom 
            and simplicity that we melt int
            o the work We hope your plac
            e is always filled with warmth</p>
